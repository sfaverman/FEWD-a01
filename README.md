FEWD Assignment 1
# Hello,
## I am **_Sofia Faverman_** ,
## FEWD2 Certificate program student at [San Diego Continuing Education](http://www.sdce.edu) college.

I have 20+ years experience working in IT field.  
Recently I have decided to follow my passion designing modern website and mobile application.

I live in San Diego since 1988, where I met my husband Mark and raised 3 children, now ages 17-21:
1. Goldie 21
2. Bella 17
3. Nicholas 17

(Guess what, Bella and Nicholas are twins!)

I love music, dance, gymnastics and beautiful warm weather in San Diego.
